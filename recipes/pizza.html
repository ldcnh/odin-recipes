    <p>This pizza is a versatile and popular food that can be customized with a wide variety of toppings to suit individual tastes, making it a favorite choice for casual meals and gatherings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough</li>
        <li>1 can of tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup of mozarella cheese</li>
        <li>Basil leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbs of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting, usually around 475-500°F (245-260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. If you like a thin crust, roll it out thinner, or leave it a bit thicker for a more doughy crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced bell pepper and zucchini to the skillet. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the pizza.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for about 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
